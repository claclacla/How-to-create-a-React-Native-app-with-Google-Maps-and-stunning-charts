# How to create a React Native app with Google Maps and stunning charts

## Create a mobile application with React Native, Google Maps and Charts

### (Under construction!)

Would you like to explore the world around you? Would you like to know if the best charts are close to you?

Use this amazing React Native application!

For the icons I have installed the package "react-native-ionicons" and I have copied the fonts from the package folder to the folder assets/fonts in the android app folder.

Splash screen

It requires an old version of JDK. I have used the version 17.
